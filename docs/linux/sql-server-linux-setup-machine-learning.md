# Install SQL Server 2019 Machine Learning Services (R, Python, Java) on Linux

[SQL Server Machine Learning Services](../advanced-analytics/what-is-sql-server-machine-learning.md) runs on Linux operating systems starting in this preview release of SQL Server 2019. Follow the steps in this article to install the Java programming extension, or the machine learning extensions for R and Python. 

Machine learning and programming extensions are an add-on to the database engine. Although you can [install the database engine and Machine Learning Services concurrently](#install-all), it's a best practice to install and configure the SQL Server database engine first so that you can resolve any issues before adding more components. 

Package location for the R, Python, and Java extensions are in the SQL Server Linux source repositories. If you already configured source repositories for the database engine install, you can run the **mssql-mlservices** package install commands using the same repo registration.

Machine Learning Services is also supported on Linux containers. We do not provide pre-built containers with Machine Learning Services, but you can create one from the SQL Server containers using [an example template available on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/mssql-docker/tree/master/linux/preview/examples/mssql-mlservices).

## Uninstall previous CTP

The package list has changed over the last several CTP releases, resulting in fewer packages. We recommend uninstalling CTP 2.x to remove all previous packages before installing CTP 2.4. Side-by-side installation of multiple versions is not supported.

### 1. Confirm package installation

You might want to check for the existence of a previous installation as a first step. The following files indicate an existing installation: checkinstallextensibility.sh, exthost, launchpad.

```bash
ls /opt/microsoft/mssql/bin
```

### 2. Uninstall previous CTP 2.x packages

Uninstall at the lowest package level. Any upstream package dependent on a lower-level package is automatically uninstalled.

  + For R integration, remove **microsoft-r-open***
  + For Python integration, remove **mssql-mlservices-python**
  + For Java integration, remove **mssql-server-extensibility-java**

Commands for removing packages appear in the following table.

| Platform	| Package removal command(s) | 
|-----------|----------------------------|
| RHEL	| `sudo yum remove microsoft-r-open-mro-3.4.4`<br/>`sudo yum remove msssql-mlservices-python`<br/>`sudo yum remove msssql-server-extensibility-java` |
| SLES	| `sudo zypper remove microsoft-r-open-mro-3.4.4`<br/>`sudo zypper remove msssql-mlservices-python`<br/>`sudo zypper remove msssql-server-extensibility-java` |
| Ubuntu	| `sudo apt-get remove microsoft-r-open-mro-3.4.4`<br/>`sudo apt-get remove msssql-mlservices-python`<br/>`sudo apt-get remove msssql-server-extensibility-java`|

> [!Note]
> Microsoft R Open is composed of two packages. If any of these packages remain after removing microsoft-r-open-mro-3.4.4, you should remove them individually.
> ```
> microsoft-r-open-mkl-3.4.4
> microsoft-r-open-mro-3.4.4
> ```

### 3. Proceed with CTP 2.4 install

Install at the highest package level using the instructions in this article for your operating system.

For each OS-specific set of installation instructions, *highest package level* is either **Example 1 - Full installation** for the full set of packages, or **Example 2 - Minimal installation** for the least number of packages required for a viable installation.

1. For R integration, start with [MRO](#mro) because it is a prerequisite. R integration will not install without it.

2. Run install commands using the package managers and syntax for your operating system: 

   + [RedHat](#RHEL)
   + [Ubuntu](#ubuntu)
   + [SUSE](#suse)

## Prerequisites

+ The Linux version must be [supported by SQL Server](sql-server-linux-release-notes-2019.md#supported-platforms), but does not include the Docker Engine. Supported versions include:

   + [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)](quickstart-install-connect-red-hat.md)

   + [SUSE Enterprise Linux Server](quickstart-install-connect-suse.md)

   + [Ubuntu](quickstart-install-connect-ubuntu.md)

+ (R only) [Microsoft R Open](#mro) provides the base R distribution for the R feature in SQL Server

+ You should have a tool for running T-SQL commands. A query editor is necessary for post-install configuration and validation. We recommend [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download?view=sql-server-2017#get-azure-data-studio-for-linux), a free download that runs on Linux.

<a name="mro"></a>

### Microsoft R Open (MRO) installation

Microsoft's base distribution of R is a prerequisite for using RevoScaleR, MicrosoftML, and other R packages installed with Machine Learning Services.

The required version is MRO 3.4.4.

Choose from the following two approaches to install MRO:

+ Download the MRO tarball from MRAN, unpack it, and run its install.sh script. You can follow the [installation instructions on MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/releases/3.4.4) if you want this approach.

+ Alternatively, register the **packages.microsoft.com** repo as described below to install the three packages comprising the MRO distribution: microsoft-r-open-mro, microsoft-r-open-mkl, and microsoft-r-open-foreachiterators. 

The following commands register the repository providing MRO. Post-registration, the commands for installing other R packages, such as mssql-mlservices-mml-r, will automatically include MRO as a package dependency.

#### MRO on Ubuntu

```bash
# Install as root
sudo su

# Optionally, if your system does not have the https apt transport option
apt-get install apt-transport-https

# Set the location of the package repo the "prod" directory containing the distribution.
# This example specifies 16.04. Replace with 14.04 if you want that version
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb

# Register the repo
dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb

# Update packages on your system (required), including MRO installation
sudo apt-get update
```

#### MRO on RHEL

```bash
# Import the Microsoft repository key
sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc

# Set the location of the package repo at the "prod" directory
# The following command is for version 7.x
# For 6.x, replace 7 with 6 to get that version
rpm -Uvh https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/packages-microsoft-prod.rpm

```
#### MRO on SUSE

```bash
# Install as root
sudo su

# Set the location of the package repo at the "prod" directory containing the distribution
# This example is for SLES12, the only supported version of SUSE in Machine Learning Server
zypper ar -f https://packages.microsoft.com/sles/12/prod packages-microsoft-com

```

## Package list

On an internet-connected device, packages are downloaded and installed independently of the database engine using the package installer for each operating system. The following table describes all available packages, but for R and Python, you specify packages that provide either the full feature installation or the minimum feature installation.

sudo zypper install mssql-mlservices-packages-py-9.4.6*
sudo zypper install mssql-mlservices-packages-r-9.4.6*
sudo zypper install mssql-server-extensibility-java
```

## Post-install config (required)

Additional configuration is primarily through the [mssql-conf tool](sql-server-linux-configure-mssql-conf.md).


1. Add the mssql user account used to run the SQL Server service. This is required if you haven't run the setup previously.

   ```bash
   sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf setup
   ```

2. Accept the licensing agreements for open-source R and Python. There are several ways to do this. If you previously accepted SQL Server licensing and are now adding the R or Python extensions, the following command is your consent to their terms:

   ```bash
   # Run as SUDO or root
   # Use set + EULA 
   sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set EULA accepteulaml Y
   ```

   An alternative workflow is that if you have not yet accepted the SQL Server database engine licensing agreement, setup detects the mssql-mlservices packages and prompts for EULA acceptance when `mssql-conf setup` is run. For more information about EULA parameters, see [Configure SQL Server with the mssql-conf tool](sql-server-linux-configure-mssql-conf.md#mlservices-eula).

3. Enable outbound network access. Outbound network access is disabled by default. To enable outbound requests, set the "outboundnetworkaccess" Boolean property using the mssql-conf tool. For more information, see [Configure SQL Server on Linux with mssql-conf](sql-server-linux-configure-mssql-conf.md#mlservices-outbound-access).

   ```bash
   # Run as SUDO or root
   # Enable outbound requests over the network
   sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set extensibility outboundnetworkaccess 1
   ```

4. For R feature integration only, set the **MKL_CBWR** environment variable to [ensure consistent output](https://software.intel.com/articles/introduction-to-the-conditional-numerical-reproducibility-cnr) from Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) calculations.

   + Edit or create a file named **.bash_profile** in your user home directory, adding the line `export MKL_CBWR="AUTO"` to the file.

   + Execute this file by typing `source .bash_profile` at a bash command prompt.

5. Restart the SQL Server Launchpad service and the database engine instance to read the updated values from the INI file. A restart message reminds you whenever an extensibility-related setting is modified.  

   ```bash
   systemctl restart mssql-launchpadd

   systemctl restart mssql-server.service
   ```

6. Enable external script execution using Azure Data Studio or another tool like SQL Server Management Studio (Windows only) that runs Transact-SQL. 

   ```bash
   EXEC sp_configure 'external scripts enabled', 1 
   RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE 
   ```

7. Restart the Launchpad service again.

## Verify installation

R libraries (MicrosoftML, RevoScaleR, and others) can be found at `/opt/mssql/mlservices/libraries/RServer`.

Python libraries (microsoftml and revoscalepy) can be found at `/opt/mssql/mlservices/libraries/PythonServer`.

Java feature integration does not include libraries, but you can run `grep -r JAVA_HOME /etc` to confirm creation of the JAVA_HOME environment variable.

To validate installation, run a T-SQL script that executes a system stored procedure invoking R or Python. You will need a query tool for this task. Azure Data Studio is a good choice. Other commonly used tools such as SQL Server Management Studio or PowerShell are Windows-only. If you have a Windows computer with these tools, use it to connect to your Linux installation of the database engine.

Execute the following SQL command to test R execution in SQL Server. If the script does not run, try a service restart, `sudo systemctl restart mssql-server.service`.

```r
EXEC sp_execute_external_script   
@language =N'R', 
@script=N' 
OutputDataSet <- InputDataSet', 
@input_data_1 =N'SELECT 1 AS hello' 
WITH RESULT SETS (([hello] int not null)); 
GO 
```
 
Execute the following SQL command to test Python execution in SQL Server. 
 
```python
EXEC sp_execute_external_script  
@language =N'Python', 
@script=N' 
OutputDataSet = InputDataSet; 
', 
@input_data_1 =N'SELECT 1 AS hello' 
WITH RESULT SETS (([hello] int not null)); 
GO 
```

<a name="install-all"></a>

## Chained "combo" install

You can install and configure the database engine and Machine Learning Services in one procedure by appending R, Python, or Java packages and parameters on a command that installs the database engine. 

1. For R integration, install [Microsoft R Open](#mro) as a prerequisite. Skip this step if you are not installing the R feature.

2. Provide a command line that includes the database engine, plus language extension features.

  You can add a single feature, such as Java integration, to a database engine install.

  ```bash
  sudo yum install -y mssql-server mssql-server-extensibility-java 
  ```

  Or, add all extensions (Java, R, Python).

  ```bash
  sudo yum install -y mssql-server mssql-server-extensibility-java mssql-mlservices-packages-r-9.4.6* mssql-mlservices-packages-py-9.4.6*
  ```

3. Accept license agreements and complete the post-install configuration. Use the **mssql-conf** tool for this task.

  ```bash
  sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf setup
  ```

  You will be prompted to accept the license agreement for the database engine, choose an edition, and set the administrator password. You are also prompted to accept the license agreement for Machine Learning Services.

4. Restart the service, if prompted to do so.

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart mssql-server.service
  ```

## Unattended installation

Using the [unattended install](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup?view=sql-server-2017#unattended) for the Database Engine, add the packages for mssql-mlservices and EULAs.

Recall that Setup or the mssql-conf tool prompts for license agreement acceptance. If you already configured SQL Server database engine and accepted its EULA, use one of the mlservices-specific EULA parameters for the open-source R and Python distributions:

```bash
sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf setup accept-eula-ml
```

All possible permutations of EULA acceptance are documented in [Configure SQL Server on Linux with the mssql-conf tool](sql-server-linux-configure-mssql-conf.md#mlservices-eula).

## Offline installation

Follow the [Offline installation](sql-server-linux-setup.md#offline) instructions for steps on installing the packages. Find your download site, and then download specific packages using the package list below.

> [!Tip]
> Several of the package management tools provide commands that can help you determine package dependencies. For yum, use `sudo yum deplist [package]`. For Ubuntu, use `sudo apt-get install --reinstall --download-only [package name]` followed by `dpkg -I [package name].deb`.


#### Download site

You can download packages from [https://packages.microsoft.com/](https://packages.microsoft.com/). All of the mlservices packages for R, Python, and Java are co-located with database engine package. Base version for the mlservices packages is 9.4.5 (for CTP 2.0) 9.4.6 (for CTP 2.1 and later). Recall that the microsoft-r-open packages are in a [different repository](#mro).

#### Package list for original CTP 2.0 and 2.1

CTP 2.2 removes **mssql-mlservices-mlm-py** and **mssql-mlservices-mlm-r** through package consolidation into **mssql-mlservices-packages-py** and **mssql-mlservices-packages-r**, respectively.

If you specifically require the original CTP 2.0 or 2.1 packages, download the following packages:

* For CTP 2.0, download package versions 9.4.5

* For CTP 2.1, download package versions 9.4.6.237


## Add more R/Python packages 
 
You can install other R and Python packages and use them in script that executes on SQL Server 2019.

### R packages 
 
1. Start an R session.

   ```r
   # sudo /opt/mssql/mlservices/bin/R/R 
   ```

2. Install an R package called [glue](https://mran.microsoft.com/package/glue) to test package installation.

   ```r
   # install.packages("glue",lib="/opt/mssql/mlservices/libraries/RServer") 
   ```
   Alternatively, you can install an R package from the command line 

   ```r
   # sudo /opt/mssql/mlservices/bin/R/R CMD INSTALL -l /opt/mssql/mlservices/libraries/RServer glue_1.1.1.tar.gz 
   ```

3. Import the R package in [sp_execute_external_script](../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql.md).

   ```r
   EXEC sp_execute_external_script  
   @language = N'R', 
   @script = N'library(glue)' 
   ```

### Python packages 
 
1. Install a Python package called [httpie](https://httpie.org/) using pip. 

   ```python
   # sudo /opt/mssql/mlservices/bin/python/python -m pip install httpie 
   ``` 

2. Import the Python package in [sp_execute_external_script](../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql.md).
 
   ```python
   EXEC sp_execute_external_script  
   @language = N'Python',  
   @script = N'import httpie' 
   ```

## Limitations in CTP releases

R, Python, and Java integration on Linux is still under active development. The following features are not yet enabled in the preview version.

+ Implied authentication is currently not available in Machine Learning Services on Linux at this time, which means you cannot connect back to the server from an in-progress R or Python script to access data or other resources. 

+ [CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY](../t-sql/statements/create-external-library-transact-sql.md) (for storing R packages in the database) is currently not available on Linux and does not support Python.  

### Resource governance

There is parity between Linux and Windows for [Resource governance](../t-sql/statements/create-external-resource-pool-transact-sql.md) for external resource pools, but the statistics for [sys.dm_resource_governor_external_resource_pools](../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-resource-governor-external-resource-pools.md) currently have different units on Linux. Units will align in an upcoming CTP.
 
| Column name   | Description | Value on Linux | 
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
|peak_memory_kb | The maximum amount of memory used for the resource pool. | On Linux, this statistic is sourced from the CGroups memory subsystem, where the value is memory.max_usage_in_bytes |
|write_io_count | The total write IOs issued since the Resource Governor statistics were reset. | On Linux, this statistic is sourced from the CGroups blkio subsystem, where the value on the write row is blkio.throttle.io_serviced | 
|read_io_count | The total read IOs issued since the Resource Governor statistics were reset. | On Linux, this statistic is sourced from the CGroups blkio subsystem, where value on the read row is blkio.throttle.io_serviced | 
|total_cpu_kernel_ms | The cumulative CPU user kernel time in milliseconds since the Resource Governor statistics were reset. | On Linux, this statistic is sourced from the CGroups cpuacct subsystem, where the value on the user row is cpuacct.stat |  
|total_cpu_user_ms | The cumulative CPU user time in milliseconds since the Resource Governor statistics were reset.| On Linux, this statistic is sourced from the CGroups cpuacct subsystem, where the value on the system row value is cpuacct.stat | 
|active_processes_count | The number of external processes running at the moment of the request.| On Linux, this statistic is sourced from the GGroups pids subsystem, where the value is pids.current |
